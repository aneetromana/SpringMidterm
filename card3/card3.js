        Vancouver has a very large population of feral cats needing homes and to be rescued. Adopting has many benefits! Not only are you saving an animal from getting euthanized, you are giving them a loving and caring home and in return cats can provide a lot of affection by easing depression and being therapeutic for health problems.
