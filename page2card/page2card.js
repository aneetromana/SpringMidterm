        adopting a cat ranges from 
        -$75 for an older cat 
        -$100 for an adult cat 
        -$150 for a kitten 
        this price includes all medical exams needed, vaccinations, food, toys and a voucher to get neutered or spayed.
        
        This money also goes toward supporting the shelter and helping them rescue more animals. Despite it costing money 
        wheb adopting a cat, the overall cost is still cheaper than if you were to purchase a cat elsewhere and all of it's 
        necessary items seperately.
